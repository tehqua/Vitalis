# Project Overview: AI-Powered Medical Consultation System

## 🎯 Introduction

**MedScreening** is an AI Agent system designed to provide intelligent medical consultation services for hospital patients. The system combines advanced AI technology with electronic medical record databases to deliver personalized, accurate, and convenient healthcare consultation experiences.

---

## 🏥 Problems to Solve

### 1. **Difficulty in Accessing Medical Information**

Patients often face challenges when:
- Needing urgent medical advice outside of doctors' office hours
- Wanting to better understand their health condition
- Needing to access their personal medical history
- Uncertain about minor symptoms and whether they need to visit the hospital

### 2. **Healthcare Staff Overload**

- Doctors must repeatedly answer similar questions from patients
- Medical staff spend time explaining basic medical information
- Traditional consultation systems don't leverage existing medical record data

### 3. **Lack of Multimodal Analysis Capability**

- Patients can only describe symptoms verbally but struggle to articulate them accurately
- Images of skin lesions or affected areas require professional analysis
- Lack of tools for preliminary self-examination before hospital visits

---

## 💡 Solution

**MedScreening** provides a comprehensive AI Agent system with the following features:

### ✅ **Intelligent Medical Consultation**

The system uses a specialized medical AI model (**MedGemma**) to:
- Answer questions about health and diseases
- Provide medical advice based on medical knowledge
- Explain medical terminology in understandable terms
- Recommend when hospital visits are necessary

### ✅ **Personal Medical History Lookup**

Patients can:
- Ask about their own medical history
- Look up previous test results and diagnoses
- View medical examination and treatment history
- Receive advice based on personal health records

> **Technology:** Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to retrieve information from the hospital's electronic medical record database

### ✅ **Medical Image Analysis**

The system is capable of:
- Analyzing images of affected skin areas
- Identifying skin diseases (fungal infections, dermatitis, etc.)
- Classifying severity levels
- Providing preliminary assessments to support decisions about seeing a doctor

> **Technology:** Uses Deep Learning models (Derm Foundation + Logistic Regression) to classify skin diseases into 8 clinical groups

### ✅ **Voice Recognition**

Patients can:
- Ask questions by voice instead of typing
- Convenient for elderly users or those with typing difficulties
- Enhance convenience and user experience

> **Technology:** Speech-to-Text processing to convert audio to text

### **3 Main Query Types**

#### 1️⃣ **General Medical Questions**
- User asks about symptoms, diseases, prevention
- Processing: Directly routed to MedGemma LLM
- Example: "What are the symptoms of diabetes?"

#### 2️⃣ **Personal Medical History Queries**
- User asks about their own medical history, test results
- Processing: RAG Agent → Retrieves data from Patient Database → MedGemma
- Example: "What were my last blood test results?"

#### 3️⃣ **Multimodal Analysis (Text + Image/Audio)**
- User sends images or audio with questions
- Processing: Image/Speech Agent → Analysis → MedGemma synthesis
- Example: *[Sends image of red skin area]* "Is this a fungal infection?"
